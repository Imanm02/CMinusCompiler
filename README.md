# CMinusCompiler

**Python3 Based One-Pass Compiler for a Simplified C-Minus**

## Overview

In this project, we aim to create a one-pass compiler for a subset of the C programming language, referred to as C-minus. It is written in Python 3 and is designed to be lightweight and straightforward. The compiler takes C-minus source code and compiles it into an intermediate representation that can be executed or further processed.

## Features

- **Token Recognition:** The compiler can recognize various tokens such as identifiers, numbers, keywords, symbols, and comments.
- **Grammar Support:** It supports a predefined grammar for parsing the C-minus language constructs.
- **Error Handling:** Implements basic error handling for syntax and semantic errors.

## Token Types and Grammar

The tokens in the below table can be recognized by the compiler:

| **Token Type** | **Description**                                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| NUM            | Any string matching `[0-9]+`                                   |
| ID             | Any string matching `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*`                     |
| KEYWORD        | `if`, `else`, `void`, `int`, `while`, `break`, `switch`, `default`, `case`, `return` |
| SYMBOL         | `;` `:` `,` `[` `]` `(` `)` `{` `}` `+` `-` `*` `=` `<` `==`    |
| COMMENT        | Any string between `/*` and `*/` OR after `//` and before a newline or EOF |
| WHITESPACE     | Spaces, tabs, and newline characters                           |

The `grammar.txt` file outlines the syntax rules that the compiler follows, which is included in the repository.

## Project Structure

The `Code` folder contains several components of the CMinusCompiler:

- `Codegen.py`: The code generation module that translates the parse tree into an intermediate representation or target code.
- `Compiler.py`: The main driver script that orchestrates the compilation process, invoking the scanner, parser, and code generator.
- `grammar.output`: Contains debugging information produced by Bison to help understand conflicts in grammar rules.
- `grammar.tab.c`: The C source code generated by Bison which includes the parsing tables and the parse function.
- `grammar.y`: The Bison grammar file defining the syntax rules of the C-minus language.
- `input.txt`: An example C-minus source code file used as input to the compiler for testing.
- `output.txt`: The output file where the result of the compilation process is stored, including intermediate code or errors.
- `Parser.py`: The parser module that takes tokens produced by the scanner and constructs a parse tree based on the grammar rules.
- `parse_table_generator.py`: A script to generate the parsing table from the grammar file which aids the parser module.
- `parse_tree.txt`: A text representation of the parse tree generated by the parser for debugging and analysis.
- `Scanner.py`: The lexical analyzer that breaks the input source code into tokens as defined in the token table.
- `semantic_errors.txt`: A log file where semantic errors detected during the compilation are recorded.
- `syntax_errors.txt`: A log file where syntax errors detected during the compilation are recorded.
- `table.json`: A JSON representation of the parse table used by the parser to guide the parsing process.

The `Docs` directory houses comprehensive documentation for the CMinusCompiler project, serving as an essential resource for understanding the project's structure and implementation. It includes detailed explanations of the compiler's components, usage instructions, and system requirements. Additionally, this folder is home to the critical `grammar.txt` file, which is placed within the `Phase 2` subdirectory, indicating its role in the second phase of the project's development.

For verification and quality assurance, the project employs a suite of test cases located in the `Tests` folder. These cases are designed to systematically evaluate each phase of the compiler's functionality, ensuring robustness and reliability.

In the third phase of the project, an interpreter housed in the `Interpreter folder` is utilized. This interpreter is integral to the project as it enables the execution of the compiled code, allowing for the demonstration and testing of the compiler's output in a controlled environment. The presence of the interpreter underscores the project's commitment to delivering a comprehensive toolset for both compilation and execution.
